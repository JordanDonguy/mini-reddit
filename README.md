# 📄 Mini Reddit

A simplified, lightweight clone of [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com), built to explore working with real data and modern web development tools.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This **Mini Reddit** app lets you browse posts and their comments based on the selected subreddit.

By default, it displays popular posts from **/r/popular**.  
You can explore other subreddits using:
- 📂 The **left sidebar** (on desktop)
- 🔍 The **search bar** in the top-right corner

## ⚙️ How It Works

After selecting a subreddit, the app displays its posts with key information:

- 🏷️ Subreddit name  
- ✍️ Post author  
- ⏱️ Time since posted  
- 📝 Post title and content (image, video, or text)  
- 💬 Button to toggle comments (includes comment count)  
- 👍 Number of upvotes  

When the user clicks to view comments, each comment shows:

- 👤 Comment author  
- ⏳ Time since posted  
- 💬 Comment text  
- 🔁 Number of replies (with toggle button)  
- 👍 Likes (upvotes)  

If a comment has replies, clicking the reply toggle reveals:

- 👤 Reply author  
- ⏳ Time since posted  
- 💬 Reply text  

🧑‍💻 On **mobile devices**, the left sidebar is hidden to maintain a clean, minimalist design — subreddits can be searched using the top search bar.
